# Your Electron Boilerplate

Welcome to Your Electron Boilerplate, the foundational starting point for building cross-platform desktop applications with Electron and React-TS. This boilerplate streamlines the development process, allowing you to focus on creating exceptional user experiences without worrying about the setup.

## Quick Start

To kickstart your project without a hassle, we've packaged this boilerplate into an easy-to-use npm package: `create-react-electron-app`. Get started with your project in just one command:

```bash
npx create-react-electron-app my-app
```
This command scaffolds a new Electron application using our boilerplate in the my-app directory. Dive into your project folder and start building right away!

## Starting Development

Start the app in the `dev` environment:

```bash
npm start
```

## Packaging for Production

To package apps for the local platform:

```bash
npm run package
```

## Technologies and Usage

Our boilerplate is packed with the latest and greatest in web and desktop application development technologies:

- **React-TS**: Write your frontend with the powerful React framework in TypeScript for more robust code.
- **Webpack**: Module bundler set up for optimizing and compiling your code into a small bundle for production.
- **Babel**: Use next-generation JavaScript, today. Babel transpiles your JS code to ensure compatibility across all platforms.
- **Electron**: The core of your desktop application, allowing you to build cross-platform applications with web technologies.
- **ESLint**: Keep your code clean and bug-free with ESLint, configured to ensure code quality and consistency.

## Highlight: IPC Communication Infrastructure

**Seamless IPC Communication**: Dive into building feature-rich applications with our boilerplate’s built-in infrastructure for inter-process communication (IPC). This setup not only simplifies messaging between your main and renderer processes but is designed to catch the eye and enhance developer experience. Start crafting intricate functionalities with less hassle and more elegance.
